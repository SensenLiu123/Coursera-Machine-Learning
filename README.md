# Machine-Learning
Andrew Ng famous ML course on Coursera. 

This course provides a basic broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 
Topics include: 
* Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
* Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
* Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 

This repo contains my solutions to all the coding assignments.
